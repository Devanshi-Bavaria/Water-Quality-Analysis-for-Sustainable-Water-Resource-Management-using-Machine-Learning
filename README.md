# Water-Quality-Analysis-for-Sustainable-Water-Resource-Management-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting water potability using various classification models. The project leverages advanced ensemble methods and a novel architecture to enhance the accuracy and reliability of water quality predictions.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning framework to classify water samples as potable or non-potable. The framework includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization using several machine learning algorithms. The primary model used is Gradient Boosting Classifier, along with other classifiers such as Random Forest, Bagging, and Support Vector Machines.

## Novel Architecture

The project features a unique architecture that integrates advanced ensemble techniques and optimizes model performance for water potability prediction. This architecture significantly improves the model's ability to correctly classify water samples.
